Sublime Text plugin to handle artifact.xml and deployment pom.xml
=====================================================

The purpose of this plugin (still in development, not fully ready to be used) is to free the developer from the burden of having to manually update artifact and pom file. Once you have created a new component under synapse-config, the script will scan through the subfolders and update missing artifacts accordingly.
